# OldBazooka Launcher
A Android Launcher to fight for an old friend.

## What is that?
This is a simple launcher activity to replace the default launcher on and old android device.

This Launcher will not launcher any activity, it will act more as a *Kiosk mode*.

The main idea around this, is to create a personalizable screen to old devices.
Giving them the ability to show something interesting, using those devices as a clock or even giving then some other functions.

Here we will avoid to use the touchscreen.

## What about the lockscreen
I made [another project](https://github.com/brunodles/LockscreenBypass) to bypass it take a look.
